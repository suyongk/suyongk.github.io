  abstract  = {Nanothermites demonstrate attractive combustion characteristics such as tunable reactivity and high energy density. There is however a lack of fundamental understanding on their burning structures and reaction mechanisms due to the multi-scale complexity associated with the material and reaction heterogeneities. This gap in turn hinders the optimization of nanothermite design with desirable microstructures and controllable burning properties. In this work, a high-speed microscopy imaging system was used to reveal the burning structure of Al/CuO nanothermites and to investigate the propagation mechanism of its flame front at micron and sub-millimeter scales which have not been studied. An Al/CuO nanothermite film was fabricated as a model structure. First, the previously proposed reactive sintering was confirmed as a micron-scale burning characteristic. Then, at the sub-millimeter scale, it was demonstrated that the non-uniform burning propagation of nanothermite films is featured with distinguishable roles of the active burning sites and the pre-ignition sites. The active burning sites are clusters of reactive sintering particles and the pre-ignition sites appear in the preheating regions where Al and CuO particles have not yet participated in the reaction due to insufficient ignition energy. These pre-ignition sites form randomly and are subsequently ignited by heat transferred from the adjacent active burning sites, resulting in an active burning propagation tangentially along the propagation front. At the same time, as the thermite reaction of nanoparticles in the unburnt region is initiated, the propagation front advances in the normal direction. This experimental work reveals that the burning propagation mechanism of nanothermite films is governed by active burning propagation in both tangential and normal directions of the propagation front. Although the rates of these two modes are on the same order of magnitude, the tangential propagation of active burning is slightly faster, implying that pre-ignition sites are readily ignited with lower ignition energy.},

  abstract = {Constant-volume combustion tests have been widely used to characterize the reactivity, the combustion efficiency, and the gas-generating performance of energetic materials. However, the currently used performance metrics (ignition delay time, pressurization rate, and maximum pressure) highly rely on the specific experimental condition, which leads to the challenge of fairly comparing the material performance tested in different conditions and laboratories. For this reason, there has been a need for a new metric independent of the experimental conditions, along with a novel analytical tool. In this work, we proposed a kinetic modeling framework to infer the chemical kinetics and thermodynamic properties from the pressure profiles in constant-volume combustion tests. In this framework, a physical model predicts the thermodynamic states of the system during the constant-volume combustion process, while an inverse model calibrates the model parameters to fit the model to the experimental observation via sensitivity analysis. We demonstrated the success of the framework in inferring the chemical kinetics and thermodynamic properties with both synthesized data and experimental measurements. Moreover, the physical model with the inferred properties enabled a comprehensive understanding of how gas release and temperature rise contribute to the pressure rise in the constant-volume reactor. Therefore, the classical constant-volume combustion experiments can be utilized to infer properties for the design of energetic materials with desired gas and heat generation profiles and for modeling the energetic behaviors in more complex systems.},

  abstract = {Kolmogorov–Arnold networks (KANs) as an alternative to multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) are a recent development demonstrating strong potential for data-driven modeling. This work applies KANs as the backbone of a neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) framework, generalizing their use to the time-dependent and temporal grid-sensitive cases often seen in dynamical systems and scientific machine learning applications. The proposed KAN-ODEs retain the flexible dynamical system modeling framework of Neural ODEs while leveraging the many benefits of KANs compared to MLPs, including higher accuracy and faster neural scaling, stronger interpretability and generalizability, and lower parameter counts. First, we quantitatively demonstrated these improvements in a comprehensive study of the classical Lotka–Volterra predator–prey model. We then showcased the KAN-ODE framework’s ability to learn symbolic source terms and complete solution profiles in higher-complexity and data-lean scenarios including wave propagation and shock formation, the complex Schrödinger equation, and the Allen–Cahn phase separation equation. The successful training of KAN-ODEs, and their improved performance compared to traditional Neural ODEs, implies significant potential in leveraging this novel network architecture in myriad scientific machine learning applications for discovering hidden physics and predicting dynamic evolution.},
